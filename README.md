# Breaktime
Usage reminder application for Android.

# About
Today, more than 2 billion active smart devices are running Android, making it the most
popular OS as of date. That means, a lot of us are looking at these devices' screens
everyday. However, with the endless possibilities of things we can do on our devices, we
seem to spend a lot more time than we should, and we don't seem to notice that our health is
already being negatively affected.
        
That's why I developed "Breaktime!". This application simply serves as a reminder for us
to take a break when using our devices. Not only does it help to reduce eye strain, it also
helps us to maintain a healthy habit by constantly reminding us to move our bodies after
a certain period of time. Now, you need not worry about our health being affected by our
devices anymore!
        
This application is made as a final project for the online course "CS50x", and I would
personally like to give credits to the team for creating such an excellent learning
experience! You can learn more about it here:
