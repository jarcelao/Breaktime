    <string name="about_message_1">
        Today, more than 2 billion active smart devices are running Android, making it the most
        popular OS as of date. That means, a lot of us are looking at these devices\' screens
        everyday. However, with the endless possibilities of things we can do on our devices, we
        seem to spend a lot more time than we should, and we don\'t seem to notice that our health is
        already being negatively affected.
    </string>

    <string name="about_message_2">
        That\'s why I developed "Breaktime!". This application simply serves as a reminder for us
        to take a break when using our devices. Not only does it help to reduce eye strain, it also
        helps us to maintain a healthy habit by constantly reminding us to move our bodies after
        a certain period of time. Now, you need not worry about our health being affected by our
        devices anymore!
